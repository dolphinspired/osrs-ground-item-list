# osrs-ground-items-list

A quick list of ground item filters and highlights for Old School RuneScape. [Visit the site here!](https://dolphinspired.github.io/osrs-ground-items-list/)

This webpage exists to provide a quick list of items that's easy to copy/paste into the OSRS mobile client. The newline characters are removed from the lists when copied from the website, as these characters will not work in the mobile clients.

Feel free to make a [Pull Request](https://github.com/dolphinspired/osrs-ground-items-list/pulls) if you'd like to add items to either list. Simply update **Filtered.txt** or **Highlighted.txt** and the results will be visible on the website as soon as changes are pushed to main.
